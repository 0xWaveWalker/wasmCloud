# Use this file in conjunction with the generic wascc-host binary to launch a
# demonstration of the graph database capability provider. 
# You'll need to launch redisgraph, easiest way to do that is with
# this docker command:
#
# docker run --name redisgraph-test -d --rm -p 6379:6379 redislabs/redisgraph
#
# NOTE: your actor subject will change from this because you will use different
# signing keys.
#
# $ curl -X POST localhost:8081 (creates nodes/edges)
# $ curl localhost:8081 (retrieves some data in a sample query)
